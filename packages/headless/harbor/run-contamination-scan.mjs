 * Scan a finished run's trajectories for signs an arm looked the answer up.
 *
 * Host-only, like everything else in this directory that touches benchmark
 * identity: the scan needs the upstream URL, pinned revision and task list to
 * search for, and those are exactly what must not be reachable from inside a
 * graded container. The scanner in `dist` holds none of them — it takes them as
 * an argument, and this is where they are loaded.
 *
 * Which cells exist is likewise not this file's inference. The run wrote them
 * down as it went; this reads that list.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node run-contamination-scan.mjs --run-root <dir> [--json <path>] [--markdown <path>]
